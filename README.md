# Code of Conscience

## About
Today, despite its protective status, one third of the world's reserves are under threat from human activity. Itâ€™s hard to monitor and stop humans from destroying our planet, but could we stop the machines they use?

Code of Conscience is an open-source software based intervention that can shutdown heavy machines in protected land areas. To make the system available for all vehicles (including older ones) we produced a small, low-cost chip - with GPS, 4G and data storage.

The system code is available here for free to everyone.

Any Construction Equipment company can access and adapt it to their own system or any company can demand it to be implemented on their or their partners fleet.

## Installation

Install dependencies
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the latest WDPA Dataset shapefile (.shp) from https://www.protectedplanet.net/. Inside this archive you will find a number of files. Locate `WDPA_MONYEAR-shapefile-polygons.shp` and `WDPA_MONYEAR-shapefile-polygons.shx` (eg `WDPA_Aug2019-shapefile-polygons.shp` and `WDPA_Aug2019-shapefile-polygons.shx`) as save them in the root of this repo.

Open `CodeOfConscience.py` and edit the `shapefile` variable to reflect the name of the .shp file you have just downloaded eg:
```python
shapefile = "WDPA_Aug2019-shapefile-polygons.shp"
```

Set the `machineLocation` (Longitude, Latitude) to a location you'd like to check
```python
machineLocation = Point(175.8704514016789, -37.73493520423763)
```

Run the tool to check the location
```sh
python3 CodeOfConscience.py
```
